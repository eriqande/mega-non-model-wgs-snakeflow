These data were run with the first installment of the CCGP Chubs.

A little bit of detail about the initial maneuvers can be found at
```
example-configs/CCGP-chub/prep/chub-prep.Rmd
```


The scaffolds and everything that we want to use are the same as in the CCGP-trout
project, so I just copied that over and then had to just make the units file.
