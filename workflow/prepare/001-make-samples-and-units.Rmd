title: "Making Chinookome samples and units"

To make samples.tsv and units.tsv, we need to get the file paths
of the fastqs and process them a bit.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

x <- tibble(
  path = read_lines("full-paths-to-fastqs.txt")
) %>%
  mutate(base = basename(path), .before = path) %>%
  separate(
    base,
    into = c(
      "sample_id",
      "plate",
      "well",
      "s_lane", # sample number in the lane
      "lane",
      "read",
      "const"
    ),
    sep = "_"
  ) %>%
  select(-plate, -well, -s_lane, -const) %>%
  mutate(
    lane = as.integer(substr(lane, 2, 4)),
    read = case_when(
      read == "R1" ~ "fq1",
      read == "R2" ~ "fq2",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = read,
    values_from = path
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    sample = sprintf("s%03d", 1:n()),
    .before = sample_id
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    unit = 1,
    platform = "ILLUMINA",
    library = str_c("Lib-", lane),
    flowcell = "HY75HDSX2", # just got this from the fastq
    .after = sample_id
  )

## Now, we want to add the barcodes to these guys too.
## Here I use IlluminaIndex+DualIndex
ex <- read_excel(
  path = "NGS WorkOrder_garza_DEC2021.xlsx",
  sheet = "Library Indexing",
  skip = 6
)

# it is sort of a hassle getting this done, they way they store their
# data in those god-awful spread sheets.  But we want set of three
# consecutive colums that start on 1, 6, 11, and 16
sets <- lapply(c(1, 6, 11, 16), function(x) x + 0:3)
listo <- lapply(sets, function(x) {
  y <- ex[, x]
  names(y) <- c("sample_name", "illumina_index", "dual_index", "dual_index_rc")
  y
}) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "lane")

## In the end, I am not going to hassle with this, since I don't
## know how GATK uses the barcodes.


write_tsv(x, file = "../units.tsv")

x %>%
  select(sample) %>%
  write_tsv("../samples.tsv")
```
